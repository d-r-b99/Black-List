# Black-List
Is an expression in which it refers to that list of persons, countries, entities or organizations which must be discarded and prevented from engaging in an activity in a particular country or group of countries, as a sign of their danger or lack of confidence in them. The government or intelligence agencies are often the ones who issue blacklists. They are also traded by employers, listing the names of unwanted workers and, as may be the case, a list issued by trade unions with the names of employers who exploit workers.
